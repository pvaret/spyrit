This is a list of features that need implementing sooner or later.

* GUI for search.
* Bookmarking of lines in output.
* Option parsing for commands.
* Improve pattern matching and highlights. Implement gags, triggers.
* Scripting.
* Configuration screens for everything.
* Switch between on/off icons rather than having two of them side by side.
* Opera-like default page.
* Split state data and configuration.
* Investigate possibility to unwind circular references by introducing weak references to World object.
* Ensure split scrollback doesn't cover search terms during a find.
* Investigate why display is slower when window has focus.
