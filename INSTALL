PREREQUISITES
=============

Spyrit requires Python 2.5 or later, Qt 4.5 or later, and the PyQt4 bindings.


INSTALLATION
============

No installation is required. Spyrit can run straight from the current directory.
To give Spyrit access to its graphic resources such as icons and interface decorations, run the 'resources/mkresources.py' script. (Spyrit can run fine without its resources, but it won't look very good.)
To start Spyrit, run 'spyrit.py' in the current directory.

Enjoy Spyrit, and please feel free to give us feedback.
