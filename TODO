Stuff to do before next release:

* Version the config file.
* Finish commands to add/edit/remove matches, highlights and actions.
* Make group case-insensitive in commands.
* Ensure non-collision of currently open log file.

This is an unordered list of features that need implementing sooner or later:

* Implement MatchGroup object to put together match pattern lists and their related actions.
* Ensure unicity of simultaneous log files!
* Refactor code to use new-style signal/slots.
* GUI for search.
* Log command.
* Bookmarking of lines in output?
* Scripting.
* Configuration screens for everything.
* Switch between on/off icons rather than having two of them side by side.

* Split state data and configuration.
* Investigate possibility to unwind circular references by introducing weak references to World object.
* Improve paging when less than a page of text is displayed initially and when /commands are used.
* GUI for completion.
* Fix unloading of sound engines when quitting?
* Make catching of Command exceptions dependant on a variable settable from a debug command?
* Online tutorial in MUSH form, why not?
* Create real help system, with possibility to register topics and stuff. Use it to reimplement /help command.
