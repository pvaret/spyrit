Stuff to do before next release:

* Make TriggersManager instance unique across app.
* Finish commands to add/edit/remove matches, highlights and actions.

This is an unordered list of features that need implementing sooner or later:

* GUI for search.
* Bookmarking of lines in output?
* Scripting.
* Configuration screens for everything.
* Switch between on/off icons rather than having two of them side by side.
* Opera-like default page.
* Split state data and configuration.
* Investigate possibility to unwind circular references by introducing weak references to World object.
* Improve paging when less than a page of text is displayed initially and when /commands are used.
* GUI for completion.
* Fix unloading of sound engines when quitting?
* Make catching of Command exceptions dependant on a variable settable from a debug command?
* Online tutorial in MUSH form, why not?
* Create real help system, with possibility to register topics and stuff. Use it to reimplement /help command.

Protocol support:

* Telnet (non-trivial option negotiation: ECHO, TTYPE, GA, SGA, EOR, NAWS; see http://www.mudpedia.org/wiki/TELNET)
* VT100 escape codes (even if we ignore them, they shouldn't be displayed! See http://www.mudpedia.org/wiki/VT100 & http://ascii-table.com/ansi-escape-sequences-vt-100.php).
* 256 color ANSI (see http://www.mudpedia.org/wiki/Xterm_color)
