This is an unordered list of features that need implementing sooner or later:

* Use exception rather than return values in match action creation.
* Better implementation of gagging, with GAG chunks instead of chunk deletion.
* GUI for search.
* GUI for completion.
* Log command.
* Bookmarking of lines in output?
* Scripting.
* Configuration screens for everything.
* Switch between on/off icons rather than having two of them side by side.
* Opera-like default page.
* Investigate possibility to unwind circular references by introducing weak references to World object.
* Fix unloading of sound engines when quitting?
* Make catching of Command exceptions dependant on a variable settable from a debug command?
* Online tutorial in MUSH form, why not?
* Create real help system, with possibility to register topics and stuff. Use it to reimplement /help command. Add pointers in the help menu! Maybe allow for '/help /command' as well.
* Make command character / configurable.
* Add /send command.
* Idea: In case of missing parameters for command, provide brief usage summary (ex: conf without parameters -> "usage: /conf [keys|set|show|worldreset|reset]")
* Aliases (/alias str 'send something to the world with [PARAMETERS]')
* Clean up ActionSet with config/shortcut-aware QAction subclasses and no closures.
* Fix paging when it starts off and is turned on later.
* Move every setting (so, net.*) to the global scope. The distinction just isn't useful.

Protocol support:

* Telnet (non-trivial option negotiation: ECHO, TTYPE, GA, SGA, EOR, NAWS; see http://www.mudpedia.org/mediawiki/index.php/TELNET)
* VT100 escape codes (even if we ignore them, they shouldn't be displayed! See http://www.mudpedia.org/mediawiki/index.php/VT100 & http://ascii-table.com/ansi-escape-sequences-vt-100.php).
* 256 color ANSI (see http://www.mudpedia.org/mediawiki/index.php/Xterm_color)
* MCCP
* MCP? MXP?
* FANSI 2.0 (see http://fansi.org/)
