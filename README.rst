ABOUT SPYRIT
------------

**Spyrit** is a modern graphical client for textual roleplaying games of the MUSH, MUCK, MOO and MUD kind. It aims to be simple and pleasant to use, while providing a number of features to make your roleplaying more enjoyable:

* Tabs with activity indications.
* Multiline input with history and togglable secondary input.
* Full Unicode support.
* Logging with ANSI colors.
* Split screen when scrolling back.
* /commands with full help (type ``/help`` from any session for a list).

**Spyrit** is a work in progress, and there are still a number of things missing before we can release version 1.0, first and foremost, configuration screens. For now you can configure things with the ``/settings`` command.


PREREQUISITES
-------------

**Spyrit** requires Python 3.6 or later, Qt 5.6 or later, and the PyQt5 bindings.
