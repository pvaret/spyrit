About Spyrit
============

**Spyrit** is a modern graphical client for text-based roleplaying games of the
MUSH, MUCK, MOO and MUD kind. It aims to be simple and pleasant to use, while
providing a number of features to make your roleplaying enjoyable.

**Spyrit** is a work in progress, and in the middle of a major rewrite. It is
currently usable, and hopefully already pleasant, but you will find that many
features are still missing.


Installation
============

**Spyrit** should work on Linux, Mac OS and Windows, but has only been tested on Linux.


Installing from sources
-----------------------

1. Install Python 3.12 or later. See https://www.python.org/downloads/.

1. Check out the code:

    git clone https://github.com/pvaret/spyrit

1. Install Spyrit:

    cd spyrit ; pip install .


This installs a `spyrit` command on your system that you can run directly.


Installing from packages
------------------------

There are no pre-built packages at this time, but that will hopefully come
sometime soon.


Feedback
========

**Spyrit** is still a work in progress. If you find bugs, or are missing
